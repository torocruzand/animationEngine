## Notes 7
- This version is compatible with versions 8 or higher of LiveCode. If this is a problem for you, use the previous versions.

## Main changes
- The library is now installed as an extension to the LiveCode IDE. So now we will have the documentation in the dictionary and the other advantages that this represents.
- The validation process of the parameters of the functions and commands was optimized.
- A new way of obtaining and saving the custom properties that use the library has been implemented.
